# Omaha Parks

We are working with citizen, government, and nonprofit members to make government and civic data accessible to the residents of Omaha so that they can use and create new ways to engage with the city and its leadership and improve Omaha's quality of life.

:tada: Welcome! We are a group of technologists, scholars, educators, scientists, coders, designers, and citizens seeking to tackle some of the city's pressing problems by leveraging technology and data to enhance civic engagement. **Omaha Parks** is a project of [Open Omaha](http://github.com/open-omaha/), which seeks to map all of the city's parks and open spaces and inventory a wide variety of amenities that the parks offer. Want to find the best parks for your toddler's age range? Need parks that are accessible? Are there issues of disrepair the city should be aware of? We seek to answer these questions and provide a portal for citizens to find parks available to their wants and needs.
